/*
This module does everything to assist CSS styles, the goals are:

1 - Change subtasks status upon a click: click = toggle between complete and incomplete

Target specifically <div class="subtask-status">incomplete</div>

Transform subtask status into [x] [ ], and the subtask itself to strike through. Find a good way to change text from normal to strikethrough or something: the <span> inside might pose a problem though
