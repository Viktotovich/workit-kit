# workit-kit
A toolkit meant to be a re-invention of the to-do list. The goal for the product is to be user friendly, and contain all the feautures a standard to-do list has with it's own spin. Code-wise this project is testing OO principes, modular way of creating objects and classes, and a senior dev way of organizing code

29AUG2024, 03:08 AM: The best cure is prevention. 600+ lines of code (albeit modular) is quite hectic to go through. It is making me dizzy but addicted in a weird way.

However, if this code were modularized even further: a separate error-handler under /component, a separate obj in another file, 100 lines of code cut here and there would have been nicer to look at it.

The increasing complexity of working with code is not debted to the difficulty of the project itself, but rather the way of organizing the code. It makes me appreciate OOP and SOLID principles more and more, especially when new feautures are added.

Working with DOM is awesome, but using DOM for interactivity, and tracking positions in arrays and subarrays (arrays within arrays) feels wrong. There must be a better way.

Additionally, at the point of time that I am writing this, this project has no UI apart from 3 or 4 lines of CSS. This project is built on confidence.
